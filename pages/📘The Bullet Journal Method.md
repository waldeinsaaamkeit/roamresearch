- **Highlights**:
	- I: The Prepration
		- NOTEBOOKS
			- “Studies suggest that your concentration suffers simply by having your smartphone in the room with you, even if it’s silent or powered off”
			- “Sitting down with your notebook grants you that precious luxury. It provides a personal space, free from distraction, where you can get to know yourself better.”
			- “Our notebook serves as a mental sanctuary where we are free to think, reflect, process, and focus”
			- “The blank pages of your notebook offer a safe playground for your mind, where you’re completely free to express yourself without judgment or expectation.”
			- “The power of the Bullet Journal is that it becomes whatever you need it to be, no matter what season of life you’re in.”
			- “In school, it can serve for your class notes. At work, it can be a tool to organize your projects. At home, it can help you set and track your goals.”
			- “Your notebook greets you each morning with the pure, blank slate of an empty page. It serves as a small reminder that the day is as yet unwritten.”
		- HANDWRITING
			- “The complex tactile movement of writing by hand stimulates our mind more effectively than typing. It activates multiple regions of the brain simultaneously, thereby imprinting what we learn on a deeper level. As a result, we retain information longer than we would by tapping it into an app.”
			- “When we put pen to paper, we’re not just turning on the lights; we’re also turning up the heat. Writing by hand helps us think and feel simultaneously.”
			- “Studies suggest that the act of writing keeps our minds sharper for longer.”
			- “The long way is the short way. True efficiency is not about speed; it’s about spending more time with what truly matters”
- II: The System
	- THE SYSTEM
		- “Your Bullet Journal can be your to-do list, journal, planner, sketchbook, or all of the above, all in one place.”
		- “As you evolve, so will the function and structure of your Bullet Journal.”
		- “If you’re following along in sequence, here’s where you’ll learn how to set up your own Bullet Journal and migrate the content from your Mental Inventory.”
		- “If you’re new to the Bullet Journal, I suggest reading through all the chapters in this part before setting pen to paper.”
	- RAPID LOGGING
		- “Our experiences—both sweet and sour—are lessons. We honor these lessons by writing them down so we can study them and see what they have to teach us.
		- “Journaling provides a powerful way of facilitating this path of self-learning. The problem with traditional journaling is that it is loosely structured and time-intensive. Rapid Logging leverages the best aspects of journaling by stripping away everything that’s not essential. It’s the language the Bullet Journal is written in.”
		- “Rapid Logging will help you efficiently capture your life as it happens so that you may begin to study it.”
		- “Be it at home, school, or the workplace, Rapid Logging will help you organize the dizzying array of things you have to contend with on a daily basis.”
		- Traditional vs Rapid Logging
	- TOPICS AND PAGINATION
		- “Topics actually serve three functions:
			- “They identify and describe content“
			- “They serve as an opportunity for you to clarify your intention.”
			- “They set the agenda for the content.”
		- “Giving your page its Topic provides that opportunity to pause. What will you capture in this space? What’s its purpose?”
		- “Once you’ve defined your Topic, write it at the top of the page. Now you’ve laid the foundation for what you want to build, but you can’t locate a building without its address. That address in your Bullet Journal is the page number, so be sure to add them as you go.”
		- “The only time we don’t use a descriptive Topic is for our Daily Log (this page ). It’s a catchall for our thoughts, so the daily Topic is simply the date, formatted as month/date/day.”
	- BULLETS
		- “If Rapid Logging is the language the Bullet Journal is written in, Bullets are the syntax. Once you’ve set up your Topic and page number, you capture your thoughts as short, objective sentences known as Bullets. Each Bullet is paired with a specific symbol to categorize your entry.”
			- “Things that you need to do (Tasks)
			- Your experiences (Events)
			- Information you don’t want to forget (Notes)”
		- “During the day, these symbols allow you to quickly capture and contextualize your thoughts in real time. Later on, they make locating specific content much easier as you scan through your pages.”
	- TASKS
		- Tasks can have five different states:
			-
			  * **Tasks**: Entries that require you to take action.
			- X **Completed Tasks**: Action has been completed.
			- >**Migrated Tasks**: Tasks that have been moved forward (hence the right arrow) into your next Monthly Log or into a specific Collection.
			- < **Scheduled Tasks**: A Task tied to a date that falls outside of the current month and is therefore moved backward (hence the left arrow) into the Future Log
			- **Irrelevant Tasks**: Sometimes the things we task ourselves with end up not mattering anymore. Their meaning simply expires or circumstances change. If it no longer matters, then it’s a distraction. Strike it off your list. One less thing to worry about.
		- **Subtasks and Master Tasks**
			- Some Tasks require multiple steps to complete. These dependencies—or Subtasks—can be listed by simply indenting them directly below their Master Task.
			- TIP: When you notice a Master Task spawning a lot of Subtasks, it can indicate that this Task is growing into a project. If that’s the case, you may want to turn this nested list into its own Collection.  If you notice that a Task is turning into a project, but you don’t have time at that moment to set up a new Collection, just log a Task to remind you to set one up later: “     Create Hawaii Vacation Collection.”
	- EVENTS
		- Events—represented by the “º” bullet—are experience-related entries that can either be scheduled preemptively (for example, “Charlie’s birthday party”) or logged after they occur (for example, “Signed the lease. Yay!”).
		- We may finish our year feeling that not much of note really happened—maybe we didn’t take that big Hawaii trip or get the promotion we’d hoped for, or maybe we thought we’d be further along in our apartment hunt than we are. Leafing through our Bullet Journal can help correct this perspective: There were celebrations, projects completed, fitness milestones achieved, clean bills of health conferred, children and pets doing adorable things, soulful talks with friends, kids, parents, or spouses, and on and on.
		- Our memories are unreliable. . Studies suggest that our recollection of how we felt can greatly differ from the way an experience actually made us feel. We can remember wonderful events in a negative way, and negative events in a positive way.
		- It’s important to keep an accurate record of how things actually happened, because we often make decisions based on our past experiences. If we operate entirely on memory, we’re apt to repeat our mistakes by fooling ourselves into believing that something had an effect it actually did not. Good or bad, big or small, jot it down. Over the days, months, and years, they will form a pretty accurate roadmap of your life. Understanding how we got to where we are today will allow us to make more informed decisions as we plot our course forward.
		- TIPS
			- I recommend unpacking experiences as soon as possible after the Event, so the details are fresh and accurate. The Daily Reflection (this page ) works well toward this end.
			- Events that need to be scheduled on specific dates that fall outside of the current month are added to the Future Log (this page ). Like birthdays, meetings, and dinners.
			- For those of you who enjoy writing, long-form or expressive journaling (this page ), you can nest Note bullets (this page ) under an Event bullet if there are important/interesting details that you want to capture about an experience for later use. Again, keep it brief:
	- NOTES
		- Represented with the “– ” dash, Notes include facts, ideas, thoughts, and observations. They log information you want to remember that isn’t immediately or necessarily actionable. This type of bullet works well for meetings, lectures, and classrooms...
		- By keeping your Notes short, you’re forced to distill information down to the essential. The more content you try to capture during a lecture or a meeting, the less you’re thinking about what’s being said.
		- One simple way to summarize all these tips is this: Keep your future self in mind. Your Notes will be useless if they can’t be deciphered in a week, month, or year from now. Do your future self a kindness and don’t sacrifice clarity for brevity. It will keep your Bullet Journal valuable for years to come.
	- SIGNIFIERS AND CUSTOM BULLETS
		- **Signifiers**
			- These are symbols used to highlight specific entries to give them additional context. Signifiers are placed in front of bullets so they stick out from the rest of your list, making them easy for the scanning eye to locate.
			- **Priority**: Represented by “*” asterisk. Used to mark a bullet as important and is most commonly paired with the Task Bullet. Use this sparingly. If everything is a priority, nothing is.
			- **Inspiration**: Represented by “!” exclamation point. Most commonly paired with a Note. Great ideas, personal mantras, and genius insights will never be misplaced again!
		- **Custom Bullets**
			- TIP: Keep Custom Bullets and Signifiers to an absolute minimum. Rapid Logging tries to remove as much friction as possible from capturing information. The more you invent, the more complex it is, and the slower you will become.
		- **Rapid Logging Summary**
			- Rapid Logging, a quick and effective way to capture and sort your thoughts into Tasks, Events, and Notes. You contain those thoughts with a Topic to help you set your intention and a page number to easily locate it again later.
	- COLLECTIONS
		- Collections are interchangeable, reusable, and customizable.
		- In the following pages you’ll learn about the four core Collections: the Daily Log, the Monthly Log, the Future Log, and the one Collection to rule them all, the Index.
	- THE DAILY LOG
		- The Daily Log is the workhorse of your Bullet Journal.
		- To set up your Daily Log, all you have to do is add the day’s date and the page number. That’s it! With your container in place, you’re all set to Rapid Log (this page ) your Tasks, Events, and Notes as they occur throughout the day. The idea is to be consistently unburdening your mind.
		- Your Daily Log is more than a simple to-do list. Yes, it serves to capture your responsibilities, but it also helps you document your experiences. It’s a safe place where your mind is free to express itself, judgment-free and always happy to welcome your thoughts as they bubble up throughout the day.
		- If you don’t fill a page, add the next date wherever you left off and you’re good to go.
	- **THE MONTHLY LOG**
		- This Collection helps you step back and take a breath before diving into the coming month. It offers a bird’s-eye view of the things you have to do, as well as your available time. If each Bullet Journal is another volume in the story of your life, then the Monthly Log marks a new chapter.
		- The Monthly Log is set up on a spread of facing pages. The left page will be your Calendar page; the right page will be your Tasks page. The Topic of this Collection is the name of the month, and we add it to both pages of the spread.
		- **Calendar Page**
			- On the Calendar page, list the dates of that month down the left edge of the page, followed by the first letter of the corresponding day of the week.
			- I prefer to log Events only after they happen. That way, the Monthly Log’s Calendar page acts like a timeline.
			- TIP: Keep your entries as short as possible, as the Monthly Log is designed for reference only.
			- TIP: For some added clarity, you can add lines dividing the weeks.
		- Tasks Page (or Mental Inventory)
			- The Tasks page of your Monthly Log will serve as your ongoing Mental Inventory page. Give yourself permission to sit for as long as it takes to offload the action items that have been swimming around your head. What matters this month? What are the priorities?
	- **THE FUTURE LOG**
		- The Future Log stores entries that have specific dates that fall outside of the current month. So if it’s September, and you’ve got a project with a deadline of, say, December 15, shwoooops , into the Future Log it goes.
		- So how does this work in practice? During the day, just continue to write everything down in your Daily Log, even future Tasks. Again, the Daily Log is there to prevent us from having to waste time thinking about where to write things down. It’s a catchall, designed to hold our thoughts until we’re ready to sort them out. When that time comes—like during Daily Reflection — you’ll transfer any bullets with a future date from your Daily Log into your Future Log. Once you do, be sure to mark the entry as scheduled “<” in your Daily Log. This way you will know that it’s been addressed, so you can temporarily offload it from your mind.
		- When you’re setting up a new Monthly Log (this page ), be sure to scan your Future Log for any items in the queue that are ready now. If so, migrate (this page ) those items from your Future Log into your Monthly Log’s Tasks page. Be sure to mark it as migrated in your Future Log.
