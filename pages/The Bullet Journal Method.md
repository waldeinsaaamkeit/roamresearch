- I: The Prepration
	- NOTEBOOKS
		- “Studies suggest that your concentration suffers simply by having your smartphone in the room with you, even if it’s silent or powered off”
		- “Sitting down with your notebook grants you that precious luxury. It provides a personal space, free from distraction, where you can get to know yourself better.”
		- “Our notebook serves as a mental sanctuary where we are free to think, reflect, process, and focus”
		- “The blank pages of your notebook offer a safe playground for your mind, where you’re completely free to express yourself without judgment or expectation.”
		- “The power of the Bullet Journal is that it becomes whatever you need it to be, no matter what season of life you’re in.”
		- “In school, it can serve for your class notes. At work, it can be a tool to organize your projects. At home, it can help you set and track your goals.”
		- “Your notebook greets you each morning with the pure, blank slate of an empty page. It serves as a small reminder that the day is as yet unwritten.”
	- HANDWRITING
		- “The complex tactile movement of writing by hand stimulates our mind more effectively than typing. It activates multiple regions of the brain simultaneously, thereby imprinting what we learn on a deeper level. As a result, we retain information longer than we would by tapping it into an app.”
		- “When we put pen to paper, we’re not just turning on the lights; we’re also turning up the heat. Writing by hand helps us think and feel simultaneously.”
		- “Studies suggest that the act of writing keeps our minds sharper for longer.”
		- “The long way is the short way. True efficiency is not about speed; it’s about spending more time with what truly matters”
- II: The System
	- THE SYSTEM
		- “Y our Bullet Journal can be your to-do list, journal, planner, sketchbook, or all of the above, all in one place.”
		- “As you evolve, so will the function and structure of your Bullet Journal.”
		- “If you’re following along in sequence, here’s where you’ll learn how to set up your own Bullet Journal and migrate the content from your Mental Inventory.”
		- “If you’re new to the Bullet Journal, I suggest reading through all the chapters in this part before setting pen to paper.”
	- RAPID LOGGING
		- “Our experiences—both sweet and sour—are lessons. We honor these lessons by writing them down so we can study them and see what they have to teach us.
		- “Journaling provides a powerful way of facilitating this path of self-learning. The problem with traditional journaling is that it is loosely structured and time-intensive. Rapid Logging leverages the best aspects of journaling by stripping away everything that’s not essential. It’s the language the Bullet Journal is written in.”
		- “Rapid Logging will help you efficiently capture your life as it happens so that you may begin to study it.”
		- “Be it at home, school, or the workplace, Rapid Logging will help you organize the dizzying array of things you have to contend with on a daily basis.”
		- Traditional vs Rapid Logging
	- TOPICS AND PAGINATION
		- “Topics actually serve three functions:
			- “They identify and describe content“
			- “They serve as an opportunity for you to clarify your intention.”
			- “They set the agenda for the content.”
		- “Giving your page its Topic provides that opportunity to pause. What will you capture in this space? What’s its purpose?”
		- “Once you’ve defined your Topic, write it at the top of the page. Now you’ve laid the foundation for what you want to build, but you can’t locate a building without its address. That address in your Bullet Journal is the page number, so be sure to add them as you go.”
		- “The only time we don’t use a descriptive Topic is for our Daily Log (this page ). It’s a catchall for our thoughts, so the daily Topic is simply the date, formatted as month/date/day.”
	- BULLETS
		- “If Rapid Logging is the language the Bullet Journal is written in, Bullets are the syntax. Once you’ve set up your Topic and page number, you capture your thoughts as short, objective sentences known as Bullets. Each Bullet is paired with a specific symbol to categorize your entry.”
			- “Things that you need to do (Tasks)
			- Your experiences (Events)
			- Information you don’t want to forget (Notes)”
		- “During the day, these symbols allow you to quickly capture and contextualize your thoughts in real time. Later on, they make locating specific content much easier as you scan through your pages.”
