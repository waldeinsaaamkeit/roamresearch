- I: The Prepration
	- NOTEBOOKS
		- “Studies suggest that your concentration suffers simply by having your smartphone in the room with you, even if it’s silent or powered off”
		- “Sitting down with your notebook grants you that precious luxury. It provides a personal space, free from distraction, where you can get to know yourself better.”
		- “Our notebook serves as a mental sanctuary where we are free to think, reflect, process, and focus”
		- “The blank pages of your notebook offer a safe playground for your mind, where you’re completely free to express yourself without judgment or expectation.”
		- “The power of the Bullet Journal is that it becomes whatever you need it to be, no matter what season of life you’re in.”
		- “In school, it can serve for your class notes. At work, it can be a tool to organize your projects. At home, it can help you set and track your goals.”
		- “Your notebook greets you each morning with the pure, blank slate of an empty page. It serves as a small reminder that the day is as yet unwritten.”
	- HANDWRITING
		- “The complex tactile movement of writing by hand stimulates our mind more effectively than typing. It activates multiple regions of the brain simultaneously, thereby imprinting what we learn on a deeper level. As a result, we retain information longer than we would by tapping it into an app.”
		- “When we put pen to paper, we’re not just turning on the lights; we’re also turning up the heat. Writing by hand helps us think and feel simultaneously.”
		- “Studies suggest that the act of writing keeps our minds sharper for longer.”
		- “The long way is the short way. True efficiency is not about speed; it’s about spending more time with what truly matters”
